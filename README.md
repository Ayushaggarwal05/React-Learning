Hii!! This is my journey to my Learning React JavaScriptðŸš€ðŸš€


-> First create basic pages like main html, css , Javascript page.
-> Then u have to ways to connect React to your project :

        ~ First is to use cnd links available at react site.
        ~ Second through NPM ( also called as Node Package Manager and sometimes we dont prefer to say this :)

-> Way to connect React to my laptop without cdn links:

        ~nmp install react (will ask some question regarding your file , create package.json and package-lock.json file )
        ~npm install -D parcel (will create parcel-cache and node modules having property to run your server for production with updated version)
        ~you can make a gitignore file to keep them for not uploading in git hub as they can be form anytime.
        ~npm parcel indec.html (this will run your server at localHost 1234)
        ~npm parcel build index.html (will ready your file for production)
        ~import react and react dom to js file

-> Improvements in package.json:

        ~update dependencies.
        ~update browserslist.
  *     ~update script and write start:npm parcel index.html to short to run for terminal as then we have to write only (npm sun start or 
        npm start)
  *     ~update script and write start:npm build parcel index.html to short to run for terminal as then we have to write only (npm sun build)

-> write tag in jsx in camel case form.

-> React Functional components is a function in a javascript which return jsx code and name of the function should start with capital letter as so js can identify it as react functional components.

-> "^Confit driven UI^" : this a practice that all company follows as it means that the UI of the page will change according to the data comming from the backend.
    ex- swiggy ,zomato and any app uses location based offer.

-> Two types of Export/Import:
        
        ~ Default Export/Import:
                - export default component
                - import component from "path";
        ~ Named Export/Import:
                -export const component
                -import {component} from "path";
