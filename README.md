Hii!! This is my journey to my Learning React JavaScriptðŸš€ðŸš€


-> First create basic pages like main html, css , Javascript page.
-> Then u have to ways to connect React to your project :

        ~ First is to use cnd links available at react site.
        ~ Second through NPM ( also called as Node Package Manager and sometimes we dont prefer to say this :)

-> Way to connect React to my laptop without cdn links:

        ~nmp install react (will ask some question regarding your file , create package.json and package-lock.json file )
        ~npm install -D parcel (will create parcel-cache and node modules having property to run your server for production with updated version)
        ~you can make a gitignore file to keep them for not uploading in git hub as they can be form anytime.
        ~npm parcel indec.html (this will run your server at localHost 1234)
        ~npm parcel build index.html (will ready your file for production)

-> Improvements in package.json:

        ~update dependencies.
        ~update browserslist.
        ~update script and write start:npm parcel index.html to short to run for terminal as then we have to write only (npm sun start or npm start)
        ~update script and write start:npm build parcel index.html to short to run for terminal as then we have to write only (npm sun build)
